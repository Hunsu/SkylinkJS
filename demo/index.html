<h1> Client API Documentation </h1>
<a href="./client-api-doc/">Here</a>
<br>
Only one module/namespace: temasys.
The public API and events appear by default. The soon-to-come APIs are tagged protected, and can be made visible by clicking the corresponding chekcbox on the top right hand corner. Private APIs, that should not be used, are also documented.
<br>

<h1> Demos as Guests</h1>
All those demos connect as Guest to the apitest account.

The media stream is handled by default by the API. It supposes 1 audio and 1 video input, and ask for a VGA resolution (640*480). More advanced stream manipulation can also be hooked up by passing a stream table to the API through the user (Demo to come). That allows audio only calls for example, or multiple input calls or resolution changes, .....
